Setting up a GitHub project
###########################

..  include::   /references.inc

I many cases, I create a new repository for a project on GitHub_ then clone
that repository to start work. Occasionally, I do things in reverse. The
project is already set up and I need to get it onto GitHub. This note is
designed to help you set your project up in either case.

..  note::

   I am assuming you have an active account on GitHub_. These are free and I
   highly recommend you set one up if you write any code of your own, and want
   to make it public (perhaps for potential employers to see). If you are a
   student, be careful not to put your coursework on this publis system.  That
   is unless you want your classmates to steal your work and get credit for
   for your hard work!

Starting from scratch
*********************

In this situation, you have a project in mind, but have not started work on
that project. You should come up with a name for your project before you go on,
though! FOr this exercise, I will assume your project is named ``TestProject``.

Start off by opening your web browser and logging into your account on GitHub_.
You should see a menu item near the top that lists all of your current
`Repositories` Click on this and you will see a button labeled "New". This is
where you will create a  new repository.
